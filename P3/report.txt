State of the solution: 
DTSV1:
Works as expected

DTSV2:
Works as expected

DTSV3:
Works as expected
There is a small amount of memory leak that I could not free.
I added free() to possible locations but the more I free, the more 
my code started to get glitchy, such as working fine until the second repeat call.

DTSV4:
Did not do it.
